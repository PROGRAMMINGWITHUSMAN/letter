    <p>Dear Ma'am,</p><br>
    <p> I am Muhammad Usman Ghani, studying in class 11th and I am writing this letter for request for a concession on 
        my school fees as my father was not keeping well for the last few  <br>months and had to opt for early 
        retirement. Therefore the family income has been vastly decreased and very less money is left for the
         expenses of my studies.</p>
         <p>I will be highly obliged if my request can be kindly considered.</p>
         <p>Sincerely, <br><br>
            Muhammad Usman Ghani
         </p>
