       Dear Arthur,</p>
    <p>Hope you are doing good my friend. I got to know that your exams are starting the next month from your
    email and you mentioned that you need some help in <br>Chemistry as you are not able to cope up with this subject.</p>
<p>Personally I feel that before starting with me helping you with the subject, youshould first find out that 
    what the problem areas are for you in this subject. Youmust <br> find out whether it is the organic chemistry or 
    name reactions or inorganicchemistry that you need help with. Whatever is your weak area, leave that to me as
    I promise <br>that I will help you understand it.</p>
    <p>For instance, if you think that your organic chemistry is stronger then you must start
        working on it. Make sure that you complete this particular segment way before <br> so
        that you can focus on other things later. Also make sure that you pen down all the
        important formulae and name reactions at one place so that you can refer to them <br>  
        at any point in time and learn them, revise them, as and when you are free. This
        would infuse you with a lot of confidence and would definitely add on to your <br>
        performance. You have one month in your hand and if you will start studying
        chemistry in this fashion then you will definitely find yourself in a much better place.</p>
        <p>We shall take up your problem area the next week and till then you can do these
            basic steps that I have mentioned above. One by one, we will focus on each and <br>
            every point where you need more clarity. Remember, you will have to be consistent
            in Chemistry and you will surely be able to make a good score. Learn the name <br>
            reactions and formulae by writing them down as this would help you know your
            faults.</p>
            <p>Don't get nervous or tensed as we have enough time with us and I will make sure
                that you are no longer scared of the subject. Just design your study schedule and <br>
                dedicate 1-2 hours every day to Chemistry and you will be sorted. Put aside all your
                fears and just study with complete focus.</p>
                <p>All the best for your exams and preparations.  <br>Regards   <br>Simon</p>
